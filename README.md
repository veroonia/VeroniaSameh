# Hello, I'm Veronia Sameh 👋

I’m a Computer Science student with a minor in **Artificial Intelligence**, driven by a passion for exploring the forefront of technology.
I’m particularly fascinated by how **AI systems are trained, optimized, and made to perform intelligently.**

I actively pursue **hands-on experience and continuous learning** in computer science and AI, and I’m eager to contribute to innovative projects and future opportunities that challenge and grow my skills.
